BSCA Superheroes Vue Project
Hannah Rauser

This is my first full-stack Vue/Express/Mongoose project.
Requirements are as follows:
To run our data base whenever we restart our computer we *must* run:

    sudo mongod

then leaving the terminal/command prompt window in which we run the command open.
This project requires the following Node/npm packages:

  -ExpressJS
  -Body Parser
  -Mongoose
and can be installed via command:

    npm install --save express body-parser mongoose
